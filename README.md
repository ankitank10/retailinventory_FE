# RetailInventory

This project was generated with [Angular CLI](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli) version 9.1.9.

## Development server

Its a teant based angule structure, so following are the ng commands as per the tenant. IN is the default tenant:

"scripts": {
"ng": "ng",
"start-IN": "ng serve IN",
"build-IN": "ng build IN --aot --prod",
"test-IN": "ng test IN",
"lint-IN": "ng lint IN",
"e2e-IN": "ng e2e IN"
}

Run `ng serve IN` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running end-to-end tests
